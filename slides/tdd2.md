### Basic Workflow

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> <span class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="3">Write a (failing) test to describe the functionality/behavior <span class="fragment status-icon" data-fragment-index="3">&#x1D5EB;</span></span>
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> <span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">Write the code necessary to make the test pass <span class="fragment status-icon" data-fragment-index="3">&#x2714;</span></span>
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> Refactor, rinse, & repeat

Note:

* First, write a test to describe what you're trying to do
    - This test should be failing, because you haven't yet written the code to make it work
* Now, write the code necessary to make the test pass.
* Once it's passing the tests, refactor to arrive at the best possible solution.
* Often referred to as "red - green - refactor"
