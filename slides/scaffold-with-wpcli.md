### Scaffolding our Test Suite

Generate test scaffolding via WP-CLI:

```sh
$ wp scaffold plugin-tests my-plugin
```

Note:

Easiest way to add tests is via WP-CLI's "scaffold" command

Able to generate appropriate files for plugins and themes. Can also automatically include tests if scaffolding a new theme/plugin.
