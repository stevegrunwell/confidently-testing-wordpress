### System Under Test (SUT)

* The system we're currently testing:
    - A single method
    - A class
    - A whole feature

Note:

An important term to understand is "System Under Test", which refers to the part of the application we're testing.

Since we want to isolate the SUT from the rest of the app, knowing _what_ we're testing helps us know how best to test it.
